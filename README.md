How to use Grid Search CV in sklearn, Keras, XGBoost, LightGBM in Python

Grid Search with Cross-Validation (GridSearchCV) is a brute force on finding the best hyperparameters for a specific dataset and model. Why not automate it to the extend we can? Stay around until the end for a RandomizedSearchCV in addition to the GridSearchCV implementation.

This is perhaps a trivial task to some, but a very important one â€“ hence it is worth showing how you can run a search over hyperparameters for all the popular packages.

In this post, I'm going to go over a code piece for both classification and regression, varying between Keras, XGBoost, LightGBM and Scikit-Learn.
